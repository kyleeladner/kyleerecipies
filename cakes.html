<h3>Red Velvet Cake</h3>
<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1/2 cup shortening</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>2 tbs cocoa</li>
    <li>4 tbs red food coloring</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
    <li>1 tbs distilled white vinegar</li>
 <h5>Icing</h5>   
    <li>5 tbs all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 cup butter, room temp.</li>
    </ul>
<h5>Directions</h5>
    <ol>
    <li> Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans.</li>
    <li>Beat shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar until very light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat well.</li>
    <li>Make a paste of cocoa and red food coloring; add to creamed mixture. Mix salt, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and buttermilk together. Add the flour to the batter, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, mixing just until incorporated. Mix soda and vinegar and gently fold into cake batter. Don't beat or stir the batter after this point. </li>
    <li>Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven until a tester inserted into the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Cool cakes completely on wire rack.</li>
     <li>To Make Icing: Cook 5 tablespoons flour and milk over low heat till thick, stirring constantly. Let cool completely! While mixture is cooling, beat 1 cup sugar, butter, and 1 teaspoon vanilla until light and fluffy. Add cooled flour mixture and beat until frosting is a good spreading consistency. Frost cake layers when completely cool.</li>   
    </ol>
<h3>Pound Cake</h3>
<h5>Ingrediets</h5>
<ul>
   <li>1 pound butter, softened</li> 
    <li>3 cups sugar</li> 
   <li>6 large eggs</li> 
   <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
   <li>3/4 cup milk</li> 
   <li>1 teaspoon almond extract</li> 
   <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li> 
    </ul>
<h5>Directions</h5>
    <ol>
    <li>Beat butter at medium speed with an electric mixer until creamy. (The butter will become a lighter yellow color; this is an important step, as the job of the mixer is to incorporate air into the butter so the cake will rise. It will take 1 to 7 minutes, depending on the power of your mixer.) Gradually add sugar, beating at medium speed until light and fluffy. (Again, the times will vary, and butter will turn to a fluffy white.) Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating just until yellow yolk disappears.</li>
    <li>Add flour to creamed mixture alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour. Beat at low speed just until blended after each addition. (The batter should be smooth and bits of flour should be well incorporated; to rid batter of lumps, stir gently with a rubber spatula.) Stir in extracts.</li>
<li>Pour into a greased and floured 10-inch tube pan. (Use vegetable shortening or butter to grease the pan, getting every nook and cranny covered. Sprinkle a light coating of flour over the greased surface.)</li>
    <li>Bake at 300° for 1 hour and 40 minutes or until a long wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from pan, and cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
<h3>Bundt Cake</h3>
<h5>Ingredients</h5>
<ul>
    <li>1 box Betty Crocker™ Super Moist™ yellow cake mix</li>
        <li>1 box (3.4 oz) Jell-O™ vanilla-flavor instant pudding & pie filling mix</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <h5>Filling</h5>
   <li>1 cup Kraft™ Jet-Puffed™ marshmallow creme (from 7-oz jar)</li>
<li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</li>
    <li>2 to 3 teaspoons milk</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
    <h5>Directions</h5>
      </ul>
    <ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 350°F. Generously spray 12-cup fluted tube cake pan with baking spray with flour.</li>
    <li>In large bowl, beat Cake ingredients with electric mixer on medium speed 2 minutes, scraping bowl occasionally. Pour into pan.</li>
    <li>Bake 38 to 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Remove from oven. Let stand 20 minutes; remove from pan to cooling rack. Cool completely, about 1 hour 30 minutes</li>
    <li>In large bowl, beat marshmallow creme, 1/2 cup softened butter, the vanilla and 2 teaspoons milk with spoon until blended. Beat in powdered sugar until fluffy. If necessary, beat in more milk, a few drops at a time, until spreading consistency. Place filling in decorating bag fitted with 1/2-inch round piping tip. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Carefully place cake top side down on cooling rack. Using melon baller, scoop out 10 1-inch holes about 2 inches deep, evenly spaced in circle around bottom of cake, reserving cut pieces. Pipe generous 2 tablespoons filling to fill each hole, or pipe until filling becomes level with bottom of cake. Place reserved pieces of cake over filling to cover. Place serving platter on bottom of cake, and turn over so cake is right side up.</li>    
    <li>When ready to serve, sprinkle top of cake with 1 tablespoon powdered sugar. Loosely cover and refrigerate any remaining cake.</li>
